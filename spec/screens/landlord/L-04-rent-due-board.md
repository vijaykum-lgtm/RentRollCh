## Interactions

| Trigger | Result |
|---|---|
| `L04-ROW` (row click) | Opens `L-05` detail panel for that rent entry |
| `L04-BTN-REMIND` | Opens `S-01` pre-loaded with the escalation level matching days overdue. Stops row-click propagation. |
| `L04-BTN-MARKPAID` | Opens a small inline form in the row: amount received (pre-filled with rent due), date received (defaults today), payment reference (optional). Confirm → row flips to Paid → receipt number is generated → toast "Payment recorded. Receipt RR-0847 created." with an Undo that reverses it for 10 seconds. |
| `L04-BTN-RECEIPT` | Opens `P-01` in a new tab |
| `L04-BTN-EXPORT` | Downloads a CSV of the current filtered view. File named `rent-2026-02.csv`. Toast confirms. |
| `L04-SEG-FILTER` | Filters the table without a page reload and updates the URL so the view can be shared or bookmarked |

## Rules and edge cases

- **Part payment.** If the amount received is less than rent due, the row
  shows "Part paid — ₹4,000 pending" and remains in the Pending filter. A
  receipt is issued for the amount actually received.
- **Vacant units** do not appear at all for months in which they had no
  tenant.
- **Mid-month move-in.** The first month's row is created with the pro-rata
  amount, and the row shows a small "pro-rata" note. The landlord can edit
  the amount before marking paid.
- **Rent rows are created on the 1st.** If that job did not run, the board
  shows a banner: "This month's rent rows have not been created" with a
  button to create them now.
- Marking paid twice is impossible — the button is replaced the moment the
  state changes.
