| Purpose | Answer one question in five seconds: is anything wrong today? Everything on this screen is either a number or a problem with a fix button next to it. |
| Leads to | `L-04`, `L-06`, `L-12`, and directly into `S-01` |

This is the single hub screen: every other landlord screen is reachable
from the sidebar, but the dashboard is where the landlord's session starts
(see `foundations.md` § A3 and the UIUX Screen map).

## Layout

Top to bottom: page header · four stat cards in a row · income chart ·
Needs attention list. Nothing else. Resist adding a second chart.

## Components

| ID | Type | Content and behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `L03-CRD-OCCUPANCY` | Stat card | Label "Occupied". Value "12 / 14". Sub-line "2 vacant". |
| `L03-CRD-COLLECTED` | Stat card | Label "Collected this month". Value in ₹. Sub-line compares to last month. |
| `L03-CRD-DUES` | Stat card | Label "Outstanding". Value in ₹, danger colour when above zero. Sub-line "across N units". |
| `L03-CRD-EXPIRING` | Stat card | Label "Agreements expiring". Value = count within 90 days. Warning colour when above zero. |
| `L03-CHT-INCOME` | Bar chart | Rent collected per month, last six months. Hover shows the exact figure. No legend, no axis clutter. |
| `L03-LST-ATTENTION` | List | Merged and sorted list of everything needing action — see § Needs attention below. |
| `L03-ROW-ATTENTION` | List row | Icon · unit number · one-line description · status chip · one action button |

## Interactions

| Trigger | Result |
|---|---|
| `L03-CRD-DUES` | Route to `L-04` with the Overdue filter already applied |
| `L03-CRD-EXPIRING` | Route to `L-12` with the 90-day filter applied |
| `L03-CRD-OCCUPANCY` | Route to `L-08` filtered to vacant units |
| `L03-CRD-COLLECTED` | Route to `L-04` for the current month, no filter |
| `L03-ROW-ATTENTION` | Route to the relevant detail — rent rows to `L-05`, requests to `L-07`, agreements to `L-12` |
| Row action "Remind" | Opens `S-01` directly, without navigating away. Closing `S-01` returns to the dashboard with the row refreshed. |
| Row action "Open" | Opens the relevant detail panel over the dashboard |

## Needs attention — what appears and in what order

| Order | Item | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Urgent maintenance request | Urgency = urgent and status is not closed |
| 2 | Rent overdue 10+ days | Unpaid and past due by 10 or more days |
| 3 | Agreement expiring within 30 days | Agreement end date minus today ≤ 30 |
| 4 | Rent overdue 1–9 days | Unpaid and past due |
| 5 | Open maintenance request | Any other open request, oldest first |
| 6 | Agreement expiring within 90 days | Agreement end date minus today ≤ 90 |

> OPEN: the Scope Document's illustrative wireframe (Diagram 4, Wireframe
> A) shows a "NEEDS ATTENTION" example in the order 4C (18 days overdue),
> 3B (agreement ends in 22 days), 1B (geyser leaking, urgent), 2A (5 days
> overdue). Applying the sort rule above to that same set of four items
> would instead order them 1B (rule 1, urgent), 4C (rule 2, overdue ≥10),
> 3B (rule 3, expiring ≤30), 2A (rule 4, overdue 1–9). The rule table above
> (from the UIUX Specification, the more precise of the two documents) is
> authoritative for implementation; the wireframe's ordering should be
> treated as illustrative only, not as an alternate spec. See Open
> contradiction #3 in `spec/index.md`.

## States

| State | Display |
|---|---|
| Loading | Skeleton shapes in place of the four cards and six list rows. Never a full-page spinner. |
| Nothing wrong | The Needs attention card shows: "Nothing needs your attention today." with a tick icon. This is a deliberate reward state, not an empty state. |
| No data at all | Only reachable if `L-02` was skipped. Shows "Add your first property to see your dashboard" with a button to `L-08`. |
| Load failure | Card-level: each card shows a retry link. One failed card does not blank the page. |
