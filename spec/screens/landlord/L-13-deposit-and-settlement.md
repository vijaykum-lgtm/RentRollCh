## Rules

- A deduction without a written reason cannot be saved. A deduction
  without a photo shows a warning but is allowed, since not everything is
  photographable.
- If deductions exceed the deposit, the balance shows as an amount owed by
  the tenant, in danger colour, and the statement wording changes
  accordingly.
- Once marked settled, the statement becomes read-only. Corrections
  require a new statement that references the first.
