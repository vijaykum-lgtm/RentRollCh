# T-01 · Report a problem (entry point)

## Meta

| | |
|---|---|
| Route | `/u/:unitToken` — one unguessable token per unit, not the unit number |
| Access | Anyone holding the link. No sign-in. |
| Purpose | Capture a problem with enough detail to act on, in under two minutes. |
| Leads to | `T-02` |

## Design brief for the whole tenant section

The tenant is on a phone, possibly annoyed, has never seen this before,
and will not read instructions. There is no sign-in, no menu and no way to
reach anything that is not theirs. If any screen here takes more than two
minutes, they will phone the landlord instead and the product has failed.

## Layout

Single column, one screen scroll. Header identifying the unit so the
tenant knows they have the right link. Form. Submit. Below the fold, a
link to their earlier reports.

## Components

| ID | Type | Content and behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `T01-HDR` | Header | Landlord's name or logo · "Flat 2A, Kulkarni Apartments" · nothing else |
| `T01-SEL-CATEGORY` | Dropdown | "What is the problem?" — Plumbing · Electrical · Appliance · Structural · Pest · Cleaning · Something else. Required. |
| `T01-FLD-DESC` | Text area | "Describe it" — placeholder: "Geyser is leaking from the bottom since yesterday." Required, minimum 10 characters. |
| `T01-UPL-PHOTO` | Photo uploader | "Add a photo" — up to 3. Optional but visually encouraged. See `S-04`. |
| `T01-SEG-URGENCY` | Segmented choice | "How urgent?" — Low · Normal · Urgent. Defaults to Normal. |
| `T01-FLD-NAME` | Text field | Pre-filled from the tenant record, editable in case a family member is reporting |
| `T01-FLD-PHONE` | Phone field | Pre-filled, editable |
| `T01-BTN-SUBMIT` | Primary button | "Submit" — full width, 48px tall, sticky at the bottom of the viewport on mobile |
| `T01-LNK-MYREPORTS` | Link | "My earlier reports (2)" → `T-03`. Hidden when there are none. |
| `T01-BTN-CALL` | Quiet button | "Call the landlord" — always visible, below the form. Some things need a phone call. |

## Interactions

| Trigger | Result |
|---|---|
| `T01-BTN-SUBMIT` | Validate → button shows spinner → request is created → the assistant assigns a suggested category and urgency in the background → route to `T-02`. If the assistant is slow or unavailable, the request is still created with the tenant's own choices; nothing waits on it. |
| Validation failure | Scroll to the first invalid field, show the error under it. Never a summary at the top, never a popup. |
| `T01-BTN-CALL` | Dials the landlord's number |

## States and rules

| State | Display |
|---|---|
| Invalid or unknown token | "This link is not valid. Please ask your landlord for your unit link." Nothing else — no hints about what a valid link looks like. |
| Unit is vacant | Same message as above. A former tenant's link stops working when the tenancy ends. |
| Submitting | Button spinner, form fields disabled, no full-screen overlay |
| Submission failed | Inline error above the button: "Could not submit. Please try again." The form keeps everything typed, including the photo. |
| Offline | A banner appears: "You are offline. Your report will be sent when you reconnect." The form remains usable. |

- The token is long and random. Unit numbers are never used in the URL,
  because `/u/2A` would let anyone guess `/u/2B`.
- Rate limit: 5 submissions per token per hour, with a plain message if
  exceeded.
- A bot check runs invisibly. A tenant should never see a puzzle.

> Note: "A former tenant's link stops working when the tenancy ends" (this

> boundary tests for the full discussion of the unit-link vs.
> tenancy-link tension.

> OPEN: the Scope Document's illustrative wireframe (Diagram 4, Wireframe
> C) shows "Urgent" as the highlighted/selected urgency option, while
> `T01-SEG-URGENCY` above (from the UIUX Specification) states urgency
> "Defaults to Normal." This may be the wireframe simply showing a filled
> example rather than depicting the default state, but the two documents
> literally disagree on which value is shown selected. See Open
> contradiction #6 in `spec/index.md`.
